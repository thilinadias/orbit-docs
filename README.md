## Recent Updates (March 2026)

### Installer & Action Fixes (v1.6 — Mar 03 2026)

Enhanced the first-time setup experience and resolved UI action failures:

- **Installer Robustness Overhaul:** The web installer now automatically creates the database (`CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS`) if it doesn't exist.
- **Migration Timeout Prevention:** Increased the PHP execution time limit to **300s** for migration and seeding tasks to support slower hardware.
- **Resilient `.env` Setup:** Improved environment variable writing logic with automatic `.env.example` fallback and permission checks.
- **Fixed Asset Actions:** Re-engineered the Edit and Delete buttons in the Asset management module, resolving an issue where they were non-functional.

## Recent Updates (February 2026)

### Document Management & Metadata Scaling (v1.5 — Feb 25 2026)

Resolved production schema desync and enhanced reliability for metadata-only updates:

- **Formal Schema Migration:** Added a version-controlled migration to resolve the `documentable` and `is_upload` column desync on production environments.
- **Null-Safe Document Saving:** Fixed a crash (Integrity Constraint Violation) when editing documents with null content (e.g., uploaded files).
- **Flexible Metadata Edits:** Form validation now allows updating document properties (Tags, Category, Status) without requiring a markdown body.
- **Cache Synchronization:** Updated the Docker entrypoint to include `bootstrap/cache` in the sync process, preventing stale code issues after deployments.

### Document Deletion & Enhanced Authorization (v1.4 — Feb 25 2026)

Added secure document management and robust permission resolution:

- **Document Deletion:** Securely remove documentation and associated physical files from storage. Restricted to Super Admins and Organization Admins.
- **512MB Upload Support:** Resolved the `413 Request Entity Too Large` error by consolidating Nginx configurations and increasing limits to **512MB** across the entire stack.
- **Dynamic Gate Resolution:** Refactored the internal authorization system to use a dynamic `Gate::after` hook.

### CI/CD Stabilization & Enhanced Security (v1.3 — Feb 25 2026)

Resolved persistent pipeline failures and enhanced the installation experience:

- **Stable GitHub Actions:** Resolved 25 persistent PHPUnit test failures related to database migration corruption and SQLite driver incompatibilities.
- **Real-Time Installer Progress:** Added a sleek, Alpine.js-powered progress bar to the web installer with live backend reporting via the `/install/status` endpoint.
- **Bit-Perfect Migrations:** Implemented Base64-mediated file transfers within Docker containers to prevent silent migration file corruption during orchestration.
- **Full-Text Search Fix:** Native support for SQLite in tests by conditionally disabling unsupported `fullText` indices while maintaining MySQL production performance.
- **Expanded User Schema:** Aligned database schema with core features, adding native support for MFA (`google2fa_secret`, `mfa_enabled`) and granular administrative permissions.

### Installer Reliability Overhaul (v1.2 — Feb 23 2026)

Complete redesign of the installation process to eliminate timeout errors:

- **Async Migrations:** Database setup now runs as a **background process** inside the container. The web request returns instantly and the browser polls for status every 3 seconds. This eliminates all Nginx gateway timeouts (504 errors) regardless of how long migrations take.
- **Fresh vs Update Split:** The Docker entrypoint now distinguishes between fresh installs and updates:
  - **Fresh install** — entrypoint skips migrations; the installer wizard owns the entire setup.
  - **Existing install** — entrypoint runs incremental `migrate --force` in the background on every restart.
  - Detection uses a `storage/app/installed` marker file written by the installer on completion.
- **Better Error Reporting:** The installer now shows the **exact PHP error message** from failed migrations in a detail box, instead of a generic "Server Error" message.
- **Idempotent Seeder:** `DatabaseSeeder` uses `firstOrCreate` for asset types, making retries safe.

### Production Deployment Fixes (v1.1 — Feb 22 2026)

A comprehensive overhaul of the Docker deployment pipeline to make production deployments reliable:

- **Critical Fix — Stale Code on Re-deploy:** The entrypoint now uses `rsync` on every container start, so code updates from a rebuilt image are always applied. Previously, the production server permanently ran the first-deployed version of the code.
- **Critical Fix — MySQL Healthcheck:** The DB healthcheck was silently failing on every boot (Docker does not expand `${VARIABLES}` in CMD-array format). Fixed to use `CMD-SHELL`. The `app` container now correctly waits for a healthy database before starting.
- **Security — Debug Files Removed:** Development helper scripts (`debug_roles.php`, `fix_cred_perm.php`, `force_suspend.php`, etc.) have been removed from the repository. They were being baked into the production Docker image.
- **Startup UX:** A branded maintenance page now shows instead of a raw browser 502 error while the app initialises. It auto-refreshes every 8 seconds.
- **Dockerfile:** Removed unnecessary `nginx` from the php-fpm container (~50MB saved). Added `rsync`.
- **PHP Config:** Fixed Windows CRLF line endings in `local.ini` that caused PHP to misread config values. `max_execution_time` now correctly set to `300s` for all requests.
- **Environment:** `.env.example` updated with production-safe defaults (`APP_ENV=production`, `APP_DEBUG=false`, correct Docker service names pre-set).
- **Volumes:** Replaced host bind-mount for `storage/logs` with a named Docker volume to prevent root-ownership issues on fresh servers.

### Key Improvements (Earlier February 2026)
- **Installer Flow:** Added a new step to automatically create your first Organization during installation.
- **Bug Fixes:**
    - Resolved "Table already exists" errors during migration.
    - Fixed "Column not found: role" error when creating organizations.
    - Fixed infinite redirect loop on the Global Dashboard (demo-msp issue).
    - Fixed "slug on string" crash when editing documents.
- **Document Management:** Added support for Tags, Categories, Authors, and Approval Statuses.

## Installation via Docker (Recommended)

OrbitDocs is designed to be installed easily using Docker. This method includes a built-in **Web Installer** that guides you through the setup process.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose

### Quick Start (New Installation)

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thilinadias/orbit-docs.git
    cd orbit-docs
    ```

2.  **Build and Start**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
    The containers will start. The app automatically:
    - Waits for MySQL to become healthy before starting
    - Sets up the `.env` file with Docker service names
    - Generates `APP_KEY` if not already set
    - Shows a branded loading page while initialising (instead of a 502 error)

    > On a **fresh install**, the entrypoint skips database migrations — the installer wizard handles that.

3.  **Access the Setup Wizard**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://<your-server-ip>`. The wizard walks you through 6 steps:

    | Step | What It Does |
    |---|---|
    | 1. **Welcome** | Checks PHP extensions and directory permissions (including `.env` writability) |
    | 2. **Database** | Verifies your MySQL connection and **auto-creates the database** if missing |
    | 3. **System Setup** | Runs `migrate:fresh` + `db:seed` with extended 5-minute timeout protection |
    | 4. **Admin Account** | Creates your super-admin user |
    | 5. **Organization** | Creates your first workspace (client/department) |
    | 6. **Network** | Choose IP or custom domain, optional SSL upload |

    After step 6, you're redirected to the login page. Sign in with the admin credentials you just created.

### Updating Existing Installations

For routine updates (code changes, bug fixes):

```bash
git pull origin master
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Code changes from the new image are automatically synced to the running volume on startup. Pending migrations are applied in the background automatically. **No manual cache clearing or migration commands needed.**

> **First-time update from a version before v1.1?** Run this instead to clear old volumes:
> ```bash
> git pull origin master
> docker-compose down -v
> docker-compose up -d --build
> ```
> ⚠️ `down -v` removes ALL data volumes. Only use this on a fresh install or if you don't mind losing existing data.

## Troubleshooting

**App shows "Starting Up" page for a long time**
This is normal on first boot — the database container takes 30-60 seconds to initialise. The page auto-refreshes every 8 seconds. If it persists beyond 5 minutes:
```bash
docker logs orbitdocs-app -f   # look for [OrbitDocs] messages
docker ps                       # check all containers are healthy
```

**After `docker-compose up --build`, the site still shows old content**
You are likely on a pre-v1.1 version of OrbitDocs. The old entrypoint only seeded the volume once and never applied updates. Upgrade by clearing volumes:
```bash
git pull origin master
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d --build
```
> ⚠️ `down -v` removes data volumes. Back up your data first if needed.

**Installer System Setup shows an error**
The installer's "System Setup" step runs migrations as a background process and polls for status. If it reports an error, the red error-detail box shows the **exact PHP error message**. Common fixes:
- **"Duplicate column" or "Table already exists"**: A previous failed attempt left the DB in an inconsistent state. Click **Retry Setup** — the installer wipes the database cleanly before re-running migrations.
- **If Retry still fails**, run migrations manually inside the container:
  ```bash
  docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --force
  ```
  Then navigate directly to `http://<your-server-ip>/install/admin` to continue the setup.

**Default Login Credentials (If Seeder Used)**
*   **Email:** `admin@orbitdocs.com`
*   **Password:** `password`

## Manual Configuration (Advanced)

If you prefer to configure the system manually or need to update settings after installation, you can use the following methods.

### Manual SSL Configuration

The Web Installer allows you to upload SSL certificates (`.crt` and `.key`). If you need to update them later:

1.  **Locate the Volume**: The certificates are stored in the `orbitdocs_ssl` Docker volume. You can access this via the host mount path defined in `docker-compose.yml` or by copying files into the container.
    
    *Recommended method (Copy via Docker):*
    ```bash
    # Copy your new certificate and key to the Web container
    docker cp your_domain.crt orbitdocs-web:/etc/nginx/ssl/orbitdocs.crt
    docker cp your_domain.key orbitdocs-web:/etc/nginx/ssl/orbitdocs.key
    ```

2.  **Restart Nginx**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose restart web
    ```

### Manual Domain Configuration

To change the domain name after installation:

1.  **Update .env**:
    Edit the `.env` file in your installation directory and update `APP_URL`.
    ```env
    APP_URL=https://new-domain.com
    ```

2.  **Update Nginx Config (If needed)**:
    The Nginx configuration is mounted at `./docker/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`.
    -   Edit this file to update `server_name` or add manual redirects.
    -   Restart the web container: `docker-compose restart web`.

## Testing

To run the application tests, use the following command:

```bash
php artisan test
```

The testing environment is configured to use an in-memory SQLite database (`:memory:`), providing a fast, isolated environment.

- **Deterministic Schema:** All migrations (Core, Standard Laravel, and Sanctum) are manually orchestrated in the base `TestCase.php` to ensure a guaranteed healthy schema for every test.
- **SQLite Optimization:** Unsupported MySQL features (like `fullText` indices) are automatically bypassed during test runs to ensure perfect driver compatibility.
