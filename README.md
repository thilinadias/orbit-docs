## Installation via Docker (Recommended)

OrbitDocs is designed to be installed easily using Docker. This method includes a built-in **Web Installer** that guides you through the setup process.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose

### Quick Start

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thilinadias/OrbitDocs.git
    cd OrbitDocs
    ```

2.  **Start the Application**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3.  **Run the Web Installer**
    -   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost` (or your server's IP).
    -   You will be redirected to the **OrbitDocs Installer**.
    -   Follow the on-screen steps to:
        -   Verify System Requirements.
        -   Configure the Database (Defaults are pre-filled for Docker).

## Manual Configuration (Advanced)

If you prefer to configure the system manually or need to update settings after installation, you can use the following methods.

### Manual SSL Configuration

The Web Installer allows you to upload SSL certificates (`.crt` and `.key`). If you need to update them later:

1.  **Locate the Volume**: The certificates are stored in the `orbitdocs_ssl` Docker volume. You can access this via the host mount path defined in `docker-compose.yml` or by copying files into the container.
    
    *Recommended method (Copy via Docker):*
    ```bash
    # Copy your new certificate and key to the Web container
    docker cp your_domain.crt orbitdocs-web:/etc/nginx/ssl/orbitdocs.crt
    docker cp your_domain.key orbitdocs-web:/etc/nginx/ssl/orbitdocs.key
    ```

2.  **Restart Nginx**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose restart web
    ```

### Manual Domain Configuration

To change the domain name after installation:

1.  **Update .env**:
    Edit the `.env` file in your installation directory and update `APP_URL`.
    ```env
    APP_URL=https://new-domain.com
    ```

2.  **Update Nginx Config (If needed)**:
    The Nginx configuration is mounted at `./docker/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`.
    -   Edit this file to update `server_name` or add manual redirects.
    -   Restart the web container: `docker-compose restart web`.
